The OpenIGTLink Library
=======================

The OpenIGTLink Library is a C/C++ implementation of
[The OpenIGTLink Protocol](Documents/Protocol/index.md).

OpenIGTLink is an open-source network communication interface specifically
designed for image-guided interventions. It aims to provide a plug-and-play
unified real-time communications (URTC) in operating rooms (ORs) for image-guided
interventions, where imagers, sensors, surgical robots,and computers from
different vendors work cooperatively. This URTC will ensure the seamless data
flow among those components and enable a closed-loop process of planning, control,
delivery, and feedback. The specification of OpenIGTLink is open, and can be
used without any license fee; hence OpenIGTLink is suitable for both industrial
and academic developers.

The latest information of the protocol is available at [OpenIGTLink Web Page](http://openigtlink.org/).
The definition of the protocol used in the current version (one in this git repository)
can be found in [Protocol Documentation](Documents/Protocol/index.md)
